<!--

Property binding: The 'disable' property will update automatically when allowNewServer updates. This is one of the main reasons to use Angular: It makes it easy to change things in the DOM at run time.

In addition to binding to HTML properties (e.g., 'disabled', demonstrated above) you can bind to other properties, such as Angular directives.

 -->
<label for="Server Name"></label>
<input type="text" class="form-control" (input)="onUpdateServerName($event)"><!-- Listens to input event, fires when user types. $event is a reserved variable name, is the data emitted with the event -->
<br><br>
{{ serverName }}
<br>
<br>
<button class="btn btn-primary" [disabled]="!allowNewServer" (click)="onCreateServer()">Add Server</button><!-- You can bind to any of the events made available to you by the html attribute -->
<!-- General rule: Don't put too much logic into your templates -->

<br><br>
<p>Allow new server? Info from string intepolation says: <strong>{{ allowNewServer }}</strong></p> <!-- Data binding with string interpolation -->
<p>Allow new server? Info from property binding says: <strong [innerText]="allowNewServer"></strong></p> <!-- Data binding with property binding -->
<br>
<p><strong>{{ serverCreationStatus }}</strong></p> <!-- Updates dynamically (2-way binding) with string interpolation -->
<br>
<app-server></app-server>
<app-server></app-server>
